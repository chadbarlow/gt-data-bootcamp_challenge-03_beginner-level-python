<h1 align="left">BEGINNER-LEVEL PYTHON<br><i>Topic: Corporate Financial Records & Local Election Results</i> </h1> 

This project aims to analyze financial records and election data using beginner-level Python expressions, statements, and functions. The goal is to utilize Python scripting skills to perform data analysis and generate results that can be printed in the terminal and exported to a text file.

## Data Science Tools

* Python

## Features

* PyBank: Analyze financial records in `budget_data.csv` with columns "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
* PyPoll: Analyze election data in `election_data.csv` with columns "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate".

## Limitations and Further Development

* Data sets are static and limited to provided CSV files.
* The analysis does not account for missing or erroneous data.
* Implement error handling and data validation.
* Expand analysis to include additional financial metrics or election statistics.
* Enhance code to handle dynamic data sets or external data sources.
